		<h1>Git Branching</h1>

		<p>The 5 types of git branches are:
		<ul>
		<li>Master Branch</li>
		<li>Develop Branch</li>
		<li>Feature Branch</li>
		<li>Release Branch</li>
		<li>Hot Fix Branch</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<p>A ticket will be worked on while on the feature branch. Once a ticket is ready for review and completion, the feature branch will merge with the develop branch. Once the ticket has been reviewed and marked as complete and ready to deploy, a release branch will be created/merged with the develop branch, and then merged with the master branch. The fifth type of branch, the hot fix branch, is only used in case of emergency, and is created off of the master branch to fix an issue, and then merged back with the master branch once the issue is fixed.
